### Signed documents, not sighs of frustration

#### Getting documents signed can be annoying

Even if you‚Äôre already doing it electronically. You spend all day asking yourself: Who‚Äôs seen it? Who‚Äôs got it? Who needs to sign it next? And once it‚Äôs signed, the trouble can start all over again. Changes get made. It might land in the wrong hands. Or someone‚Äôs signature doesn‚Äôt look quite right‚Ä¶

#### But signing is different with VeriDoc Sign.



* Because it's a 100% secure eSignature solution built on blockchain technology. In simple terms? It means your signed documents can‚Äôt ever be tampered with.
